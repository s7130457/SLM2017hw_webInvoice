Feature: Issuing invoices for companies
  In order to avoid errors
  As a Teddysoft employee
  I want to brainlessly issue an company invoice with tax included price


  Scenario Outline: Successful issuing invoices using tax included prices
    Given Ｔhe VAT rate is 0.05
    And   the tax included price provided is <tax_included>
    When  I issue a company invoice
    Then  I should see the VAT is <VAT>
    And   the tax excluded price is <tax_excluded>
    Examples:
    # VAT = Value Added Tax
      | tax_included    | VAT   | tax_excluded | notes            |
      | 36000           | 1714   | 34286       | Refactoring定價  |

      | 11              | 1     | 10           | 邊界條件           |
      | 0               | 0     | 0            | 可以開零元發票     |
